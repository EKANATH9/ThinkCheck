Hey everyone,
I wanted to take a moment to introduce something I’ve been working on — it’s called **ThinkCheck**.

ThinkCheck is an AI-powered learning platform designed to help students and professionals improve their skills through an interactive and personalized experience. Whether you’re preparing for exams, interviews, or just want to learn something new, ThinkCheck offers everything in one place: quizzes, written answer evaluations, study roadmaps, and downloadable notes.

Here’s how it works. The platform uses Gemini AI to power several features. You can choose dynamic multiple-choice questions based on topic and difficulty, write answers and get them evaluated instantly with a score, generate custom study roadmaps tailored to your progress, and download clean, organized notes to review offline.

ThinkCheck includes different modes like MCQ mode, where you can practice questions and see smart analysis, and Written mode, where your descriptive answers are scored automatically. There's also a roadmap generator that suggests what to focus on next, and a notes section to help you revise efficiently.

On the technical side, the frontend is built using React.js and styled with Tailwind CSS. The backend runs on Node.js and Express.js, and the AI engine behind the scenes uses the Gemini API. The app is deployed on Render, and optionally, it can use MongoDB to store and track your learning progress.

You can try the live demo here: [https://thinkcheck-1.onrender.com/](https://thinkcheck-1.onrender.com/)

If you're a developer and want to check it out locally, it's simple:

* Clone the repository from GitHub
* Install the dependencies for both backend and frontend
* Add your Gemini API key to a `.env` file
* Start the servers and you're good to go

ThinkCheck was created to make learning more adaptive, more intuitive, and less overwhelming. If this sounds like something useful to you, I’d love for you to check it out and share it with others who might benefit.
